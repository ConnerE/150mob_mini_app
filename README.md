Overview:
This is a simple Android app created as a project for Mobile Development class.
The app has a counter with which the user can track how many drinks they've had,
and recommends the user to go home after the 10th one (aggressive amount, certainly).

Usage Instructions:
The app was created using the Android development environment. Once running, clicking
the button on the main screen adds 1 to the drink counter. After 10, follow the 
recommendation on screen!

Running Requirements:
Requires Android 6.0+.

Reflection:
Everything that's in the app, I learned. This is my first mobile project ever, so 
I had to learn how to use the software, had to understand views, and had to
understand how code played into the GUI. I learned how to switch views based on
certain events, and I learned a bit about Java (first time).

If I could expand on this, I would allow the user to specify how many drinks they
want to have, and include an element of time (i.e. 1 drink per hour). Beyond that,
a neat feature would be to use some Uber API to call an Uber once they've had
a number of drinks.
